# AMI-database1
We retrospectively studied patients with acute myocardial infarction diagnosed in the cardiac care unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from January 2014 to January 2019.All patients received three-dimensional echocardiography, coronary angiography, and 24-hour dynamic electrocardiogram within 24 hours of admission. Outcome events were defined as whether or not tachyarrhythmia occurred. Arrhythmic events includeï¼šatrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and frequent atrial premature), ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular flutter, ventricular fibrillation, and frequent premature ventricular), supraventricular tachycardia.
The file contains two Excel files. The file named 'Raw data' is the original file of 2084 AMI patients. The file named 'variable Conversion' is a concrete display based on the AMI's original variable conversion.
